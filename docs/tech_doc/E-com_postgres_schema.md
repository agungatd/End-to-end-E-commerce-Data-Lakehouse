Here's a suggested database schema design for an e-commerce company that accommodates your listed tables, their relationships, and other necessary tables. Additionally, I'll mention which tables might better fit a NoSQL database depending on the use case.

### **Relational Database Schema (RDBMS)**

#### 1. **Customers**
- `customer_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `address`
- `registration_date`
- `acquisition_channel_id` (Foreign Key to `customer_acquisition_channels`)

#### 2. **Customer Acquisition Channels**
- `channel_id` (Primary Key)
- `channel_name`
- `description`

#### 3. **Products**
- `product_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `description`
- `price`
- `category_id` (Foreign Key to `product_categories`)
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

#### 4. **Product Categories**
- `category_id` (Primary Key)
- `category_name`
- `parent_category_id` (Self-referencing Foreign Key)

#### 5. **Product Availability Logs**
- `log_id` (Primary Key)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key to `products`)
- `status` (e.g., "in stock," "out of stock")
- `timestamp`

#### 6. **Inventory**
- `inventory_id` (Primary Key)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key to `products`)
- `quantity`
- `warehouse_location`

#### 7. **Orders**
- `order_id` (Primary Key)
- `customer_id` (Foreign Key to `customers`)
- `order_date`
- `order_status`
- `total_amount`
- `payment_method`

#### 8. **Order Items**
- `order_item_id` (Primary Key)
- `order_id` (Foreign Key to `orders`)
- `product_id` (Foreign Key to `products`)
- `quantity`
- `price`

#### 9. **Marketing Expenses**
- `expense_id` (Primary Key)
- `campaign_id` (Foreign Key to `marketing_campaigns`)
- `amount`
- `expense_date`

#### 10. **Marketing Campaigns**
- `campaign_id` (Primary Key)
- `campaign_name`
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `budget`
- `target_audience`

### **NoSQL Database Tables**

NoSQL is better suited for use cases requiring high scalability, flexibility, and unstructured or semi-structured data. Below are the tables and reasons to consider NoSQL:

#### 1. **Website Traffic (NoSQL)**
- Frequent writes with high velocity (e.g., user clicks, page views).
- Schema-less structure allows flexibility for different data types.
- **Fields:**
  - `traffic_id` (Primary Key)
  - `session_id`
  - `customer_id` (if logged in)
  - `page_url`
  - `timestamp`
  - `referrer`
  - `browser_info`

#### 2. **Cart Events (NoSQL)**
- Real-time updates and high write/read throughput for tracking cart interactions.
- **Fields:**
  - `event_id` (Primary Key)
  - `session_id`
  - `customer_id` (if logged in)
  - `product_id`
  - `event_type` (e.g., "add_to_cart," "remove_from_cart")
  - `timestamp`

---

### **Potential Additional Tables**

#### 1. **Shipping Details**
- `shipping_id` (Primary Key)
- `order_id` (Foreign Key to `orders`)
- `shipping_address`
- `shipping_method`
- `shipping_status`
- `tracking_number`

#### 2. **Payments**
- `payment_id` (Primary Key)
- `order_id` (Foreign Key to `orders`)
- `payment_date`
- `payment_amount`
- `payment_status`
- `payment_gateway`

---

### **Relationships**

1. **Customers ↔ Orders:** One-to-Many (a customer can place multiple orders).
2. **Orders ↔ Order Items:** One-to-Many (an order contains multiple items).
3. **Products ↔ Product Categories:** Many-to-One (a product belongs to a category).
4. **Products ↔ Inventory:** One-to-One (inventory corresponds to each product).
5. **Marketing Campaigns ↔ Marketing Expenses:** One-to-Many (a campaign can have multiple expenses).
6. **Customers ↔ Customer Acquisition Channels:** Many-to-One (a customer comes from a channel).

---

### **Summary**

- Use **RDBMS** for transactional data (orders, products, customers, inventory) to maintain data consistency.
- Use **NoSQL** for high-frequency, non-transactional data (website traffic, cart events) to ensure scalability and flexibility.
